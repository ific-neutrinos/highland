- Those files/folders contain setup dependent things. 
  * psycheEventModel/src/xxxId
  * highlandEventModel/src/Versioning.hxx
  * highlandUtils/src/ProductionUtils.cxx
  * highlandTools/src/SetT2KStyle.H
  * highlandIO/src/CreateMiniTree.cxx
  * highlandCorrections: FOLDER TO BE REMOVED ??

- Remove RooTracker stuff, T2K related

- psycheSelections/src/baseSelection.cxx. This probably needs to be removed, including the folder. Official selections would go one day into psychePDSelections

- baseAnalysis calls anaUtils::FillCategories(&vtx, det, IsAntinu, GetSpill().GetIsSandMC()). If these variable have not been added by the analyzer, this gives errors. We should move this from baseAnalysis.

- if we have a FillCategories method for each analysis, shouldn't we have also a DefineCategories method?

- is DefineProductions necessary?

- Why InitializeBase on AnalysisAlgorithm?

- We should tidy up CreateMiniTree stuff. Too many things on CreaMiniTree when it is supposed to be a base algorithm. Also, on CreaMiniTreePD there is some "FilterInfo" method that does nothing because it is called nowhere.

- There's a problem when creating the event from the spill and the bunch. The Event.EventInfo is copied in BaseDataClasses from Spill->EventInfo (AnaEventInfoB) and hence all information from AnaEventInfo (EventTime) and AnaEventInfoPD (NominalBeamMom) is lost. This needs to be solved.

- Since moving to root 6_21, CMake17 complains about names/pahts with '/' â†’ dictionaries cannot be saved in the build/dict folder. For the moment they are saved in build, but it is just a temporary walkaround. A proper solution is needed.
