- Those files/folders contain setup dependent things. 
  * psycheEventModel/src/xxxId

  * highlandUtils/src/ProductionUtils.cxx
  * highlandTools/src/SetT2KStyle.H
  * highlandIO/src/CreateMiniTree.cxx
  * highlandCorrections: FOLDER TO BE REMOVED ??

- Remove RooTracker stuff, T2K related

- psycheSelections/src/baseSelection.cxx. This probably needs to be removed, including the folder. Official selections would go one day into psychePDSelections

- baseAnalysis calls anaUtils::FillCategories(&vtx, det, IsAntinu, GetSpill().GetIsSandMC()). If these variable have not been added by the analyzer, this gives errors. We should move this from baseAnalysis.

- if we have a FillCategories method for each analysis, shouldn't we have also a DefineCategories method?

- is DefineProductions necessary?

- Why InitializeBase on AnalysisAlgorithm?

- We should tidy up CreateMiniTree stuff. Too many things on CreaMiniTree when it is supposed to be a base algorithm. Also, on CreaMiniTreePD there is some "FilterInfo" method that does nothing because it is called nowhere.
