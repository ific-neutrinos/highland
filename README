The ighland distribution contains the following: 

- README: this file
- CMakeLists.txt: file used by cmake to know how to compile and build executables
- src: folder with the highland code
- scripts: folder with some useful scripts

The folders src and scripts are described below


src
----------------------

Contains the source code of the highland framework, organized in two sets of packages, psyche and highland2


scripts
----------------------

- INSTALL.sh: creates makefile, compiles and sets all environment variables. Ready to execute !!!!
- cleanup.sh: removes everything created during compilation. It should be run from parent highland folder 

- setup.sh: sets environment variables needed prior to compilation
- setup_cmake.sh_template: template used to build a script that sets some environment variables 
- chrootmap: used internaly by cmake
- chsetup: used internally by cmake


INSTALLATION
----------------------

To compile the code and set the environment just type:

> source scripts/INSTALL.sh

This needs to be done only the first time. If you change the code to recompile just do 

> cmake --build build
> cmake -P build/cmake_install.cmake 

Alternatively go inside the build folder and do:

> make
> make install


EXECUTION
-------------

> pion.exe -v -o output.root input.root
