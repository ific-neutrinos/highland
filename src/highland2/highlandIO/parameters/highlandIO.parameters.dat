Whether to enable the CT4/CT5 POT correction, and the DQ
corrections. These must be applied when creating the flat
tree, so that POT counting is correct. Applying the same
corrections in baseAnalysis when using FlatTree files as 
input will have no effect. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT
YOU KEEP THESE CORRECTIONS ENABLED!
